# Dev-- wha?? ‚Äî The Evolution from SysAdmin to DevOps and Why It Matters

---

## üåç Introduction

The term **DevOps** has become one of the most defining concepts in modern IT and software delivery. It represents not just a role or toolset, but a **cultural and technical transformation** that unites software development (**Dev**) and IT operations (**Ops**) into one collaborative process.

Traditionally, developers wrote code and ‚Äúthrew it over the wall‚Äù to operations teams, who deployed and maintained it. This led to **slow releases**, **reliability issues**, and **communication silos**. DevOps breaks that wall down.

At its heart, **DevOps is about speed, stability, and collaboration** ‚Äî helping organizations deliver high-quality software faster, more securely, and with continuous improvement.

## üöÄ The DevOps Philosophy

DevOps integrates **people**, **processes**, and **tools** to shorten the development lifecycle. Its goal is to ensure that software evolves **rapidly and reliably**, without compromising stability or user experience.

Here‚Äôs how DevOps transforms traditional workflows:

| Traditional Model | DevOps Model |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Developers write code, Ops deploys | Developers and Ops collaborate end-to-end |
| Manual builds and testing | Automated CI/CD pipelines |
| Infrequent releases | Continuous deployment and feedback |
| Reactive troubleshooting | Proactive monitoring and observability |

---

## üß© The Core DevOps Lifecycle

DevOps can be visualized as an **infinity loop**, representing continuous processes that feed into each other:

Each phase supports automation, collaboration, and feedback:

Plan ‚Üí Requirements, user stories, backlog management.

Code ‚Üí Writing modular, testable software.

Build ‚Üí Automated builds via Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.

Test ‚Üí Automated unit, integration, and security testing.

Release/Deploy ‚Üí CI/CD pipelines for seamless delivery.

Operate/Monitor ‚Üí Continuous visibility through Prometheus, Grafana, and **ELK**.

üõ†Ô∏è Key Tools in the DevOps Ecosystem
| Category | Common Tools |	Function |
|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| Version Control |	Git, GitHub, GitLab |	Manage source code collaboratively |
| CI/CD	| Jenkins GitHub Actions, GitLab CI | Automate build, test, and deployment |
| Infrastructure as Code (IaC) | Terraform, Ansible, CloudFormation |	Automate provisioning of infrastructure |
| Containerization	| Docker, Podman |	Package applications and dependencies |
| Orchestration |	Kubernetes, Helm |	Manage containerized workloads |
| Monitoring |	Prometheus, Grafana, Zabbix |	Visualize performance and health |
| Security	| SonarQube, Trivy, Vault |	Integrate security into pipelines (DevSecOps) |

üß± Architecture of a Typical DevOps Environment
Below is a simplified view of how DevOps integrates across teams and infrastructure layers:

üíª Hands-On Example ‚Äî Automating App Setup and Deployment

To make DevOps practical, let‚Äôs walk through a short automation exercise where we:
- Set up Node.js and NPM.
- Download and deploy a simple Node.js application from AWS S3.
- Run it in the background.

Below is the annotated Bash script you can execute on an Ubuntu VM.

# EXERCISE: Automate Node.js App Setup and Deployment

#!/bin/bash
#EXERCISE 9: 8-extended Start Node App- 
#Refresh repo index
apt update -y

#Create user environment variable 
NEW_USER=myapp

#Accept input into Log_directory
read -p LOG_DIRECTORY

if [ -d $LOG_DIRECTORY ]
then
    echo "$LOG_DIRECTORY exists"
else
    echo "creating a new directory"
    mkdir -p $LOG_DIRECTORY

#Install NodeJS
apt install -y nodejs

#install NPM
apt install -y npm

#Get versions of NodeJs and NPM and confirm both are installed
nodejs_version=$(nodejs --version)
npm_version=$(npm --version )

if [ -z "$nodejs_version" ] && [ -z "npm_version" ]
then
	echo "Nodejs $nodejs_version and Npm $npm_version installed not present."
else
	echo "Nodejs $nodejs_version and Npm $npm_version present and  installed."
fi

Get artefact from AWS repo
runuser -l $NEW_USER -c "wget https://node-envvars-artifact.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/bootcamp-node-envvars-project-1.0.0.tgz."

#Unzip the tar file
runuser -l $NEWUSER -c "tar -xvzf bootcamp-node-envvars-project-1.0.0.tgz"

#Set environmental variables
export APP_ENV=dev
export DB_USER=myuser
export DB_PWD=mysecret
source ~/.bashrc

#Change the directory to the directory of the unzipped tar file
cd package/

#Run NodeJS server in background
npm install &
node server.js & 

#Check if node server is running
ps -aux | grep nodejs

#Show port in use
sudo netstat -lntp | grep :3000




`#!/bin/bash`

**Refresh repository index**
`apt update -y`

#Define environment variable
`NEW_USER=myapp`

# Accept input into Log directory

read -p *Enter log directory path: * LOG_DIRECTORY

if [ -d *$LOG_DIRECTORY* ]; then
    echo *$LOG_DIRECTORY exists*
else
    echo *Creating new directory...*
    mkdir -p $LOG_DIRECTORY
fi

**Install NodeJS
apt install -y nodejs

**Install NPM
apt install -y npm

**Verify installation
nodejs_version=$(nodejs --version) npm_version=$(npm --version)

if [ -z *$nodejs_version* ] && [ -z *$npm_version* ]; then
    echo *NodeJS or **NPM** not installed.*
else
    echo "NodeJS $nodejs_version and **NPM** $npm_version installed successfully."
fi

**Get application artifact from AWS repo
runuser -l $NEW_USER -c "wget [https://node-envvars-artifact.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/bootcamp-node-envvars-project-1.0.0.tgz"](https://node-envvars-artifact.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/bootcamp-node-envvars-project-1.0.0.tgz*)

**Extract tar file
runuser -l $NEW_USER -c *tar -xvzf bootcamp-node-envvars-project-1.0.0.tgz"

**Set environment variables**
export APP_ENV=dev export DB_USER=myuser export DB_PWD=mysecret source ~/.bashrc

**Navigate to extracted package**
cd package/

**Install dependencies and start app**
npm install & node server.js &

**Check Node process**
ps -aux | grep node

**Display open port**
sudo netstat -lntp | grep :**3000** *

echo *‚úÖ Node app deployed successfully!*
